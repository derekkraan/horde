defmodule Horde.GracefulShutdownManager do
  # Horde.GracefulShutdownManager notifies the processes CRDT when a child of the supervisor
  # is terminated and the node is shutting down.
  #
  # This ensures a smooth transition when a node is shutting down. If we did not do this here,
  # then we would have to wait until all children of the supervisor were done shutting down
  # before releasing them to be restarted on other nodes. If some child processes take much
  # longer than others to terminate, then this will result in some child processes being
  # unavailable for longer than necessary.
